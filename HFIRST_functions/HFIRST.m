% HFIRST is described in the paper:
% Orchard, G.; Meyer, C.; Etienne-Cummings, R.; Posch, C.; Thakor, N.; and Benosman, R., "HFIRST: A Temporal Approach to Object Recognition," Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, IEEE Transactions on vol.37, no.10, pp.2028-2040, Oct. 2015
% 
% [S1out, C1out, S2out, C2out] = HFIRST(TD, S2_path, training)
% applies the HFIRST model to the Temporal Difference (TD) data "TD" where "TD" is a struct with
% fields:
% TD.x -> vector of event X-addresses (in pixels)
% TD.y -> vector of event Y-addresses (in pixels)
% TD.ts -> vector of event timestamps (in microseconds)
% TD.p -> vector of event polarities (1 or -1 for ON or OFF events
% respectively)
% all fields are strictly integers only
% 
% "S2_path" is a string telling the function where the S2 filter
% coefficients must be loaded from. See the section "Training the
% S2_Filters" in file "full_NMNIST_example.m" to see how the filters are
% created.
% 
% 
% "training" is a boolean flag to indicate whether the model is being
% trained, in which case only the S1 and C1 results are returned because the S2 filters are not yet defined.
% 
% set "training = 0" or omit the training parameter to ensure the full model runs
% 
% set "training = 1" to only compute S1 and C1 results. In this case
% "S2_path" is ignored
% 
% S1 and S2 parameters are all set inside the HFIRST function itself
